git add _file name or *_                  Adds files, make them ready for the commit. Make them Tracked and Staged.
git commit -m "_commentary_"              Commit files, make them ready to be pushed. Transform Staged into Unmodified.
git push                                  Pushes the git repository to the server, uploads changes that were made locally.
